# Portfolio Website (Kaboom.js Interactive Room)

This is a personal portfolio site built with **Kaboom.js**, where visitors can explore an interactive 2D room and open pop-up modals to learn more about me (Evy!), my projects, and my experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Player**: Move around the room using arrow keys or WASD.
- **Hotspots**: Walk into certain areas to trigger pop-up modals with information.
- **Pop-up Modals**: Show "About Me", "Projects", and "Experience" content.
- **Pixel Art Sprites**: Custom room and player graphics.

## How It Works
The site uses [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) for rendering the game scene and controlling player movement, plus regular HTML/CSS for modal windows.

**Controls**:
- Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) or WASD to move
- Walk into a hotspot to trigger a modal
- Click "Close" to dismiss the modal
